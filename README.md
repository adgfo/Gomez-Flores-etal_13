# Paper title

This repository provides relevant files referenced in **[our paper](https://supportive-red-diamond-rattlesnake.anacondaapps.cloud/)** (link will be updated when the paper is published). Feel free to use the files, but please acknowledge their source by citing this repository and/or the paper.
The repository includes four folders: **figures**, **databases**, **LSTM**, and **web-application**.

## figures

*A link to download the figures in the paper in high-resolution is provided in this folder.*

## databases

*The seven databases used in the paper are provided in this folder.*

The seven databases are Database0_SS, Database0_SP, Database1_SS, Database1_SS_XDLVO, Database1_SP, Database2_EP, and Database3_CP.

## LSTM

*Representative code for the machine learning model is provided in this folder.* The machine learning model is a deep **long short-term memory (LSTM)** neural network.

The code includes package versions, database loading, database scaling, LSTM setting up, and training and testing.

## web-application

*A link to access the free web app of an XDLVO model is provided in this folder.*

The app is for a surface element approach in a sphere-sphere configuration. The size distrubutions of two spheres of different diameters are considered.

This folder also contains trained scalers, trained machine learning model, and images used in the web app.
